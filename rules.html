                        <p>The objective of Monopoly is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting, and selling of property.</p>

Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards and tax squares. Players receive a salary every time they pass "GO".</p>

                            <li>For railroads, rent depends on how many railroads you own</li>
